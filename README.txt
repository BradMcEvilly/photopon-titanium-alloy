Barebone 2.0.0 README
=====================

Thank you for downloading Barbone distribution. 

This distribution includes a full working Titanium project source code, 
and a full-layered .psd source file(s). It's ready to run (almost) 
out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your pack consists of the following four 
directories:

    * [project]
      Includes a fully functional titanium application project.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to 
      third-party licenses.
    * [psd]
      Includes the full-layered psd file(s) this application is 
      based on.
      
You can use the titanium project to build a final mobile application or 
to create your own titanium project for any platform, as long as this 
is permitted by the License. You can dig into the source psd files and 
modify them the way you want and reuse, as long as this is permitted by 
the License.
